# HangmanProject

Are you ready to play one of the best games in the world?

With this version of Hangman, you get a chance to play the classic game, while watching your hangman being drawn line by line!

Can you save your hangman?

First, select the play button.

Then, choose from one of the categories to get words of that type. Random gives you all of the categories, plus more.

Finally, click the letter buttons to spell out the word, and win before it's too late!

If you see a {} in the word or phrase that you have to guess, that means there is a space in that word or phrase.

Keep in mind that you only have 9 tries to get it right.

Good Luck and Have Fun!!!
